# timer-snack-box
a snack box with a timer on it so i stop eating too fast (im fat) 

so basically i was thinking to myself
  why am i snacking a whole lot in just a little amount of time
well... im eating too fast
so i thought of an idea to fix that
  i take a laser and a sensor to time when my hand reaches into a custom box
  the laser tracks what time my hand exits and starts like a 1-1.5 minute timer
  when the timer runs out i can reach my hand back in and the cycle continues
im just too lazy to watch the clock tbh
  maybe ill add a speaker or an LED to also signal that i can put my hand back in the box
